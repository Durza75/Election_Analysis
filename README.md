## Election-Audit Summary  

This script can be used for virtually any election, in any region, as long as three elements are replaced: the candidate names, the counties, and the data set. This is as simple as going back to the code and replacing the new candidate and county names with the ones currently listed. The algorithm still functions the same, but the variables would be different. Finally, and obviously, the data that was used to pull the quantity of votes would have to be replaced; preferrably in csv format.
